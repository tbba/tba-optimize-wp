    <h2>TBA Optimization for Speed and GDPR</h2>
    <p>
      
      This function optimizes your WordPress site for both speed 
      and GDPR compliance by removing unnecessary features while 
      ensuring that Web-Application Firewalls (like NinjaFirewall) can still handle XML-RPC and REST API
      security features as intended. It disables emojis, embeds, REST API links, 
      and Dashicons for non-logged-in users. Additionally, it improves performance by 
      removing jQuery Migrate for guests and optionally removes HTML comments for 
      better front-end optimization. Each feature can be toggled individually 
      to suit your site's needs, ensuring compliance with GDPR and faster load times for users.</p>
